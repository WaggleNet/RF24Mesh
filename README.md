# WaggleNetNet

The repository is forked from nRF24/RF24Mesh and modified to fit our needs. The documentation of the original repository can be found at: https://tmrh20.github.io/RF24Mesh

## Overview

WaggleNetNet allows WaggleNodes (https://github.com/WaggleNet/WaggleNode) to form a tree-like mesh network using the nRF24L01 2.4GHz Wireless Transceiver hardware. It handles dynamic address allocation of the nodes with some additional address filtering and security features (currently developing). Some examples are provided to be run on the Arduino and Raspberry Pi platforms but other libraries need to be linked during compilation.

## Quick Setup

To run this, you need compatible hardware:

* WaggleNet DevBoard P3, Versions 1.0 +
* nRF24L01 2.4GHz Wireless Transceiver
